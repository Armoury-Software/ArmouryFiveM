**Credits**

Never should you change the credits (for example in the source code comment section) to claim this resource to be your own. 90% of the users will recognize this npm package as being fivem-js, so changing the name of it and removing the credits section, is just useless. You're just being extremely rude and nodoby likes you anymore if they find out you're a big fat liar.
